# Betrayal at House on the Hill
This project is a solution to the management of players statistics in the boardgame Betrayal at House on the Hill. The boardgame includes a double sided cardboard cutout displaying a character and their stats along with four small plastic pointers that attach to the cardboard. The idea is that the pointers slide along the edge of the cardboard to point at a number relating to that users stats. In practice though, the plastic slides freely on the cardboard making it impossible to track your stats accuratly without aiding the current method, or replacing it with an alternative method.
